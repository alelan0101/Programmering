#5-10. Checking Usernames: Do the following to create a program that simulates how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.
#Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.
current_users = ['John', 'Jane', 'Bob', 'Alice', 'Mike']

#Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.
new_users = ['JOHN', 'JANE', 'Alexander', 'Thomas', 'Mikkel']

#Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used. If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a new username. If a username has not been used, print a message saying that the username is available.
for new_user in new_users:
    if new_user.lower() in [user.lower() for user in current_users]:
        print(f"Sorry, {new_user} is already taken. Please enter a new username.")
    else:
        print(f"{new_user} is available.")

#Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted. (To do this, you’ll need to make a copy of current_users containing the lowercase versions of all existing users.)
